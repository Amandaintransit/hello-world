I am a lover of dogs - my two rescues (Gemma & Scarlett) rule the house. I love to travel, especially to NYC for Broadway shows. I'm staff attorney for a family court judge. Looking to learn to code both as a hobby and to secure freelance jobs for experience and, let's be honest, extra income to keep up with Gemma's & Scarlett's  caviar tastes.
